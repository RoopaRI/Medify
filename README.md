Front-End Developer Assignment: MEDIFY - Medical Center Slot Booking Platform

Assignment Objective

The objective of this assignment is to build a React-based web application that allows users to find medical centers in a specific state and city across the USA and book appointments. 

Key Features to Implement

Landing Page:
A top navigation bar with access to platform sections such as Find Doctors, Hospitals, Medicines, and more.
A search section for users to select a state and city, leading to a list of available medical centers in the chosen area.
Both State and City should have a dropdown where the options will be fetched from an api which is provided in the problem description.
And other sections as provided in the figma design.

Search Results Page:
A listings view showing available medical centers in the selected location with the option to book appointments.

Booking Interface:
A detailed booking section for users to select a medical center, with a calendar-like interface to choose an appointment date.
The ability to book an appointment within a time frame from today up to one week in advance.
A selection of available time slots for the selected day.

My Bookings Page:
A personalized page displaying all user bookings, including details such as the medical center's name, appointment date, and time.

Responsive Design:
Ensure that the application is fully responsive and adheres to the design standards presented in the Figma screenshots.
NOTE: Implementing carousels is mandatory. You can utilize the Swiper library.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
